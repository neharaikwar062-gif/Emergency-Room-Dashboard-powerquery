# Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard (Excel Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on designing an interactive **Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard** using Microsoft Excel.  
The aim of the project is to demonstrate end-to-end Excel data analysis skills, including data cleaning, pivot-based analysis, and dashboard creation for operational monitoring.

This is a **process-oriented project**, highlighting *how the analysis was performed* rather than drawing business conclusions.

## 📊 Pivot Table Analysis
Pivot tables were created to support dashboard visuals, including:
- Patient count analysis
- Admission status aggregation
- Age group distribution
- Gender-wise grouping
- Department referral grouping
- Daily-level aggregation for trend analysis

These pivot tables act as the backend for dashboard visuals.
